So if it needs to be saved in a specific folder, or needs Internet access, or needs anything beyond simply double clicking the executable, document all that here. This is very IMPORTANT! Also, list all forms of interaction here, so if your program allows the user to press ‘Q’ to exit, or ‘left arrow’ or ‘right arrow’ to do specific things, document that here as well.
