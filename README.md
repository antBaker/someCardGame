Instructions for use (allowable actions): [Provide DETAILED  instructions on how to run AND interact with your program. If we cannot run it with relative ease, it will NOT be marked! So if it needs to be saved in a specific folder, or needs Internet access, or needs anything beyond simply double clicking the executable, document all that here. This is very IMPORTANT! Also, list all forms of interaction here, so if your program allows the user to press ‘Q’ to exit, or ‘left arrow’ or ‘right arrow’ to do specific things, document that here as well. If we cannot figure out how to interact with your program and nothing is documented, it will NOT be marked!]

Tools used: [List and describe any .NET libraries or external tools that you imported for use in your project]

Concepts used: [List ALL aspects of the CSc 102 curriculum that your project uses. So if your program uses Lists, Files, Recursion, Dictionaries, Custom classes, etc.; document them here and provide directions as to where those concepts are used in the code base. Please use the standard topics list on the Think Sharply with C# web page for the list of anticipated topics/concepts]

Assumptions: [State ANY assumptions about how you expect the system will be used or run]

Limitations: [State ANY limitations concerning what your program cannot do, though those functions may be implied by the nature of the project]

CSC 102 - Project  Module

Interacting with people not just programming.
Why do we need SE? - Software engineering

To Do: Over Holiday
-Project Proposal doc 1-2 pages
-GitHub Version Control Watch Videos
-Code must be pushed on gitHub in Java
-5 min presentation

Software Development
-coding with management - Absract idea to complex software. Conversion between an idea and then making it into code.
-Complex task better handled if considered as a process defines smaller steps that can be managed better.
-The software process is

Software development as engineering
-develop a solution to design and construct for a specified need of the populace.

SDLC Software Development Life Cycle
framework that describes the order in which activities are performed at each stage of a software-based project.

Outlines stages, activities and task involved in the creation, development and maintence.

REQUIRMENTS - product requirements document
DESIGN - software architecture
IMPLEMENTATION - awctuallly software
VERIFICATION
MAINTENANCE
DEPLOYMENT? - to see if program can cope at scale whilst being used.

What does the user REQUIRE? - analysis
Find techniques and tools
-functionality
-behaviour 
-perfomance requirements

Get infomation
-Test user Customer 
-User 
-System userss manuals and reports
-Other similiar system

Requirmetns and Analysis WHAT SOFTWARE
What beeds to be analyzed?
Discover boundaries of new System or how it must interact with its environment
-Detect and resolve conflicts between user and requiremnets
-Negotiate priorities of stakeholders
-Prioritize and triage requirements
-Classify requirements information into various categories 

DESIGN - HOW TO DEVELOP IT?- BLUEPRINT OF SOFTWARE
-all risks
-technologies:What kind of technologies are you going to use OOP for example. Writing the object like DECK. Deck deck = new Deck(int[] cards); Scanner sc = new Scanner(Obj);
-software architecture -- everything about the software
-interface representations == storyboards
-algorithmic details -- object diagram (UML)

UML Diagrams
GAME class
-decksize int
-isPlayerDone boolean
HAND class
-cardTotal
-name String
-handSize int
CARD class
DECK class
-push void get card out
-pop  remove from array
