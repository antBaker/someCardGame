Project title: [Pyramid Solataire]

Project page: [https://github.com/antBaker/someCardGame]

Instructions for use (allowable actions): [Provide DETAILED  instructions on how to run AND interact with your program. If we cannot run it with relative ease, it will NOT be marked! So if it needs to be saved in a specific folder, or needs Internet access, or needs anything beyond simply double clicking the executable, document all that here. This is very IMPORTANT! Also, list all forms of interaction here, so if your program allows the user to press ‘Q’ to exit, or ‘left arrow’ or ‘right arrow’ to do specific things, document that here as well. If we cannot figure out how to interact with your program and nothing is documented, it will NOT be marked!] 

Most likely there will be a runnable executable file that will play the game. Difficulty will be chosen and the user will be playing Pyramid Solataire. Once either the user has no moves or wins a play again option will be shown. 

Tools used: [List and describe any .NET libraries or external tools that you imported for use in your project] Github, git, possibly andriod studio.

Concepts used: [List ALL aspects of the CSc 102 curriculum that your project uses. So if your program uses Lists, Files, Recursion, Dictionaries, Custom classes, etc.; document them here and provide directions as to where those concepts are used in the code base. Please use the standard topics list on the Think Sharply with C# web page for the list of anticipated topics/concepts]

-We currently implemented shuffling cards and some array modifications. We also use String manipulations.

Assumptions: [State ANY assumptions about how you expect the system will be used or run]
-It will be run on a computer with the whole game downloaded.

Limitations: [State ANY limitations concerning what your program cannot do, though those functions may be implied by the nature of the project]
-Hopefully none XD it is a simple game
